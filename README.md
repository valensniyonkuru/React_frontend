React + Vite
![Uploading 1p.pngâ€¦]()

summary
-------
1. **React Basics**: You started with setting up a React app and displayed a simple "Hello World" message.
2. **Component Structure**: You learned to build components like `App`, `Header`, `Sidebar`, and `Footer` and organize them to form the basic layout.
3. **Styling**: You added CSS styling with Tailwind to enhance the visual structure.
4. **Routing**: You used `react-router-dom` to add routes, enabling navigation between pages like Home and About.
5. **State Management**: You explored `useState` to manage dynamic data within components, like counters and form inputs.
6. **Form Handling**: You implemented a contact form to capture and handle user input.
7. **Reusable Components**: You designed reusable components (e.g., `Header`, `Sidebar`), keeping the app modular and maintainable.
8. **Interactivity with State**: State-made components are interactive, allowing user actions to update the UI dynamically.
9. **React Component Hierarchy**: Finally, you structured your app by nesting and organizing components, enabling a responsive and efficient layout.
